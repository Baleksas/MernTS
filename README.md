# RGTS

### Description

Full stack application with functionality similar to Reddit. This project required a complex architecture and high-quality code structure, and I found it to be one of the most challenging projects I have worked on. The project was supported by 14 hours of tutorial and additional hours of troubleshooting and problem solving. 

### RGTS features

1. Secure authentication system - login/register backed up by argon2 encryption
2. Ability to create posts and store them in PostgreSQL as well as upvotes, users and relationships between all of these entities, with metadata such as creation date
3. Ability to sort posts by date or amount of updoots (upvotes)
